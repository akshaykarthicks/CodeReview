# Simple Stock Picker App using Streamlit

This document explains how to use the simple stock picker application built with Streamlit.  This app provides a basic interface for generating stock recommendations.


## What the code does

This Streamlit application allows users to input the desired number of stock recommendations and receive a list of suggested stock symbols.  The current implementation uses placeholder data; you'll need to replace the placeholder recommendation logic with your own stock selection algorithm.

## Who is it for?

This app is intended for anyone interested in exploring basic Streamlit applications or as a starting point for building a more sophisticated stock recommendation system.


## How it works

1. **User Input:** The user specifies the number of stock recommendations they want (between 1 and 10).
2. **Recommendation Generation:** When the user clicks the "Get Recommendations" button, the `get_stock_recommendations` function is called.  Currently, this function returns a predefined list of stock symbols.  **You should replace this function with your own algorithm to generate actual stock recommendations based on your criteria (e.g., using financial data, machine learning models, etc.).**
3. **Output:** The application displays the generated list of recommended stock symbols.


## How to run it

1. **Prerequisites:** You need to have Streamlit installed. If not, install it using  `pip install streamlit`
2. **Run the app:** Navigate to the directory containing `app2.py` in your terminal and run the command `streamlit run app2.py`.
3. **Interact:**  The application will open in your web browser. You can then enter the number of recommendations and click the button.


## Example Usage

1. Run the app as described above.
2. Enter "3" in the input field for the number of recommendations.
3. Click the "Get Recommendations" button.
4. The app will display a list similar to this: `['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']` (This might vary slightly depending on the placeholder data).

**Important:** Remember to replace the placeholder `get_stock_recommendations` function with your actual stock picking logic.  This example provides only a basic structure; it does not include any real-world financial analysis.
